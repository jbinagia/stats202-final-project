- part 1&2:  7/10
- part 3: 7/27
- part 4: 8/3
- final tweaks and writeup until 8/14 (due date)

## To-do
- part 1
  - how to better define eficacy?
- part 2
  - k-means clustering
    - Why is the objective function so large? How *large* is large? Is this acceptable?
    - How to visualize k-means when there are 30 predictors?
      - <https://www.datanovia.com/en/lessons/k-means-clustering-in-r-algorith-and-practical-examples/#visualizing-k-means-clusters>
      - I.e. we should do PCA before k-means 
    - To-do: plot total error as a function of k to find out at which point there is no longer a gain in increasing the model flexibility. Choose minimum k possible.
